# testGISData
Collection of simple files for testing systems performing geospatial Extract-Transform-Load.

Files are KML, KMZ, zipped Shapfiles, and GeoJSON.
Note that styled geometry can be generated in different ways, hence the googleEarth generated files being provided as they handle KML styling differently from GeoJSON.io

All data is around the [island of Vis (OSM link)](https://osm.org/go/xdstSmy-), this was arbitrarily chosen
